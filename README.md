# Web Automation Testing (Selenium & Python)

This project uses Selenium WebDriver with Python to automate testing for the Expense Tracker Web Application. The automated tests ensure that the applicationâ€™s core functionalities, such as adding, editing, and deleting expenses, work as expected.

## Technologies Used:

Python: Programming language used to write the test scripts.<br>
Selenium WebDriver: A browser automation tool used to simulate user actions and validate functionality.<br>
ChromeDriver: Web drivers for controlling Chrome or Firefox browsers during automated testing.


##  Test Cases:
Test Case 1: Verify the "Get Started" button functionality<br>
Test Case 2: Verify that the user can fill out the expense form<br>
Test Case 3: Verify the "Add Expense" button functionality<br>
Test Case 4: Verify that the added expense is displayed on the screen<br>
Test Case 5: Verify the Edit functionality for an existing expense<br>
Test Case 6: Verify the Delete functionality for an existing expense<br>
Test Case 7: Verify the Expense List is updated after Add/Edit/Delete actions

## Running Automated Tests:
To run the automated tests using Selenium with Python:

1. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   
   pip install selenium


3. Download the appropriate WebDriver:

   Download the correct version of ChromeDriver or GeckoDriver for your browser.

4. Run the test script:

   Navigate to the directory where the test scripts are stored.

5. Execute the Python test file:
   
   python test_script.py

6. Test Results:
   
   After running the tests, view the results in the console or generate a test report.
